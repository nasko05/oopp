### Backlog


### Submission

Mark: Pass

Feedback: Students submitted a single pdf file. 
###### remove the second latex file from gitlab. 


### Backlog Structure

Mark: Pass

Feedback: The recommended structure includes a list of stakeholders,
important terms of the domain, a list of user stories, and mockups that illustrate the application.


### Epics

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: The example of a backlog that you got from last year is outdated.
Instead of structuring your backlog by Musts, Shoulds, Coulds,
you were asked during the lecture to model every feature individually as an  _epic_ .
Your list of epics should be complete and its prioritization should be consistent with lecture.
You should also contain an epic for a "minimal app".
Your epics should have an introduction that clarifies the features and use mock-ups to complete descriptions.
The assignment got updated on Thursday, so there is some new stuff there that you probably haven't noticed before.

(Note that this is only a draft, so this mark will not have an impact on your final grade).


### User Stories

Mark: Good

Feedback: The user stories follow the required format and have a clear user perespective. 
Stories describe one particular interaction/workflow and have little to no overlap. 
The backlog does not contain contradicting requirements and the user stories do not overlap.
All epics should be covered with a good amount of user stories (which is hard to judge since you followed a different structure right now). 
But since you bolded out the most important features it seems like you don't have any gaps. 


### Acceptance Criteria

Mark:Good/Very Good

Feedback: The size of most user stories is small and their effect is clear, so their acceptance criteria are implicit. 
Overloaded user stories are disambiguated by defining concrete acceptance criteria.
However, some of your user stories / acceptance criteria are not formulated in a measurable/observable way.
They lack clarity and are ambiguous.
Because of that, it is impossible to say when a story is done/finished.
