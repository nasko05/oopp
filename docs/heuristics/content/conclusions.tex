\section{Conclusions and Improvements}

Overall, exactly 20 problems were identified in the design of the Talio application. Also, 4 of these usability issues received a severity score higher than 10, which suggests that there was a notable amount of negligence involved in the first design of the front-end of the application. 

Additionally, the majority of the usability problems identified had relatively high impact, but small frequency - that is possibly the main reason why they were not spotted in the initial process of developing the design for the application.

Furthermore, 23\% of the total problems found by the experts were identified as false-positives.
