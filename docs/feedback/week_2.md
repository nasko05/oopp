## Formative Assessment

- **Chair**: Zhuoyue
- **Notetaker**: Augustinas


#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass

Feedback: There were a chair and a minute taker for the meeting.


#### Agenda

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: Agenda was delivered on time and followed the template. 
You don't need to specify start time / end time for each point.
You can just approximate how much time each point will take.

#### Chair performance

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: The chair took the most initiative in the meeting. However, the meeting seemed a bit unorganised. 
I noticed that you were going back and forth between topics.
Next time, try checking with your team if everyone is ready to move on to the next agenda point, 
and if yes, wrap up the discussion for that point. If a chair doesn't have control over the meeting, the meeting becomes chaotic.
For example, during this meeting the chair seemed to try to close the meeting, 
but after that there was still a discussion about CoC. So in the future the chair should try to stay more in charge.

#### Time management

Mark: Good

Feedback: You manged to cover all of your topics,
however topics like CoC took much more time than initially planned.
It seemed to me that while having your discussions you side tracked a bit which
lead to making the meeting more chaotic and wasting some time.
So for the future, make sure you stay focused on one topic at a time.

#### Minute taker performance

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: There is an excellent amount of notes.
It contains all team agreements and a list of tasks that need to be completed for when and by whom.
Great job!

#### Relation

Mark: (very) Good

Feedback: Everyone was involved and the contribution to discussions seemed more over equal (great job!). 
However, you could try to encourage each other to speak up even more.
