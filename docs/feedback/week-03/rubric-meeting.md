# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Chair: Atanas

Minute taker: Zhuoyue

Mark: Pass

Feedback: There was a chair and a minute taker.


#### Agenda 

Mark: Sufficient 

The agenda was sent through mattermost on time.
###### It should be on gitlab before the meeting
It followed the template.
Can you always add who is the chair and who is the minute taker.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: ----------

Feedback: The template changed from last week.
The performance of the previous minute taker can be seen in the feedback from last week.


#### Chair performance

Mark: Sufficient/Good

Feedback: All topics of the agenda were covered. 
All topics were covered for an appropriate amount of time, but they took more time than planned in the agenda. 
The chair tried to control the meeting by saying "lets discuss it during another meeting". 
The meeting still seemed a bit unorganised and seemed chaotic at times. 
You could improve on closing discussions. 


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: The team take ownership of the meeting. Everyone was active in the discussions. 
Everyone seemed to listen to each other and seemed comfortable asking questions, 
giving comments and asking questions. 



#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: They had a discussion presenting how far they are for tasks for this week 
(They discussed in detail the gitlab assignment). There were planing the GUI of the application. 
There is some progress visible compared to last week. They are planning on starting to code next week. 
Right now, you should really focus on starting to code, and I hoped to see more discussion about your coding plans.

After you start coding we expect you to:
Present a current state of their *potentially shippable* application. 
Present to me all changes that were merged to main.
(You could have it as one of the agenda points).
